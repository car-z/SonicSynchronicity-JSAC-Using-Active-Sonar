# SonicSynchronicity-JSAC-Using-Active-Sonar
CMU REU Project: By demonstrating that OFDM pulses, traditionally used for wireless communications, can also be leveraged for SONAR-based sensing, we pave the way for future acoustic JSAC applications.

This repo includes documented signal generation and processing pipelines for OFDM pulses to perform sensing, and also parallel sensing pipelines for FMCW chirps (used in traditional radar).

For OFDM-based sensing, the pipeline can accurately track one moving object, and offers another option to track up to two moving objects a time. 
The FMCW-sensing pipeline has the option of plotting the range vs time of a moving object, the range vs time with static noise removed, and the 3D motion vs time.
