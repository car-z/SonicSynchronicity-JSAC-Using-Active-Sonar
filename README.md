# SonicSynchronicity-JSAC-Using-Active-Sonar
CMU REU Project: By demonstrating that OFDM pulses, traditionally used for wireless communications, can also be leveraged for SONAR-based sensing, we pave the way for future acoustic JSAC applications.

This repo includes signal generation and processing pipelines for OFDM pulses to perform sensing, and also parallel pipelines for FMCW chirps (used in traditional radar).
